# trong

C# lookup-based translater with declension/glossing modifications and IPA output.



A sample has been provided in samplelanguage.db. It contains the translation of:
"This is a sample language"
In addition, it also includes the prepositive declension for pas participles. This is added to the output when #pp is appended to a word in the glossing input.
